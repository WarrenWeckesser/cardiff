This program requires FLTK and libtiff.

The following instructions (and the corresponding
Makefiles) are not up-to-date.

Build the program using a Makefile in the src directory.

For cross-compiling in Linx for Windows:
$ make -f Makefile.win32xc

For building the executable on the Mac laptop:
$ make -f Makefile.mac
$ mv Cardiff Cardiff.app/Contents/MacOS
To export the Mac application:
$ rm -rf ~/tmp/Cardiff.app
$ svn export Cardiff.app ~/tmp/Cardiff.app
Then zip up the Cardiff.app directory in ~/tmp. (Or use
StuffIt, or some other archiving mechanism.)

For Linux, dynamically linked:
$ make -f Makefile.linux
For statically linked (still testing this):
$ make -f Makefile.linux cardiff_static
